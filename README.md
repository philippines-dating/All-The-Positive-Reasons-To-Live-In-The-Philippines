# All The Positive Reasons To Live In The Philippines

If you're a foreigner who is looking to relocate to the Philippines, then this article is just for you.

Most Westerners look to the Philippines as a new home once they've found a good Pinay girl to settle down with, or they're soon to retire and are actively looking for a Philippines woman, as a new girlfriend or wife.

## Philippines Food is Absolutely Delicious

The local Philippines style of cooking differs from other Asian countries, due to outside cultures from Austronesian, Malay, Spanish, Chinese and American influences.

What are popular Philippines dishes you should try?

- Paellas and cocidos (from the Spanish era)
- Pancit (noodles)
- Torta (omelette)
- Longganisa (Philippine sausage)
- Puchero (beef in bananas and tomato sauce)

## English is Spoken by Everyone

Did you know the Philippines have a total of 87 native tongues?

But the great thing is that the English language pulls the entire population together.

There is little need to learn and understand the native Tagalog language. The Filipino people all endeavour to understand abd speak English the best they can.

Don't worry about Tagalog.

## Like Travel? You Get the Best Beaches

Are you wanting to [impress a new Filipino girlfriend](https://pinayromances.com/blog/how-to-impress-talk-to-a-filipino-woman)? Or even to make a significant impression on an existing girlfriend or Filipina wife?

A trip or holiday to a [local Philippines beach is ideal](https://pinayromances.com/blog/top-8-beach-spots-to-take-your-filipina-girl) for this and some of the best beaches in the world are located right on your doorstep. The Philippines has some of the best beaches in the world!

- Palawan was ranked first as the best island in the World by Conde Nast Travel Magazine
- Bounty Beach (in Malapascua)
- Calitang Beach (in El Nido)
- White Beach (in Boracay)
- Paliton Beach in (Siquijor)

My choice has always been Borocay Island, since you have a wide variety of beaches to choose from. White Beach is just one of many.

## Low Cost Of Living

You'll always hear South-East Asian countries are the place to retire due to low-cost living. The Philippines is the same.

As an example, in the USA, you can get a three-course meal for two people for around $50. In the Philippines, you'll pay around $11. Believe it!

The same applies for accommodation. You'll rent for about 1/5 the price as the USA.

This low-cost drives your living costs for better longevity.

## Fantastic Diving Opportunities

I've always loved my time in the Philippines especially when it comes to beach-life and my love of diving.

Research yourself, of course. My preferred diving sites are:-

- Yapak (Boracay)
- Balicasag Fish Sanctuary (Bohol)
- Mactan Island (Cebu)
- Monad Shoal (Malapascua)

You'll enjoy stunning and colourful underwater creatures too.

## Unique Wildlife

Don't like diving or the beach?

Don't worry as the Philippines also has a diverse range of unique and beautiful wildlife too.

The Philippines is one of the 17 megadiverse countries on the Planet.

If wildlife is your thing, then the Philippines is the place to be.

Some of the most interesting mammals you'll find are the Philippine deer, the tamaraw of Mindoro and the Philippine tarsier.

## Perfect Weather for Living

Local temperatures, in the country, range between 70OF and 90OF.

January as the coldest. And when I say coldest, I mean it's still warm lol.

May as the hottest month.

There are three main seasons in the Philippines:-

- a hot, dry season from March to May
- a rainy season from June to November
- a cooler, dry season from December to February

West Philippines is a part of the typhoon belt. This affects the Luzon, Bicol, and Eastern Visayas regions.

## Nightlife to Get Your Mojo On

![The Philippines has great nightlife and festivals](images/filipino-girl-at-philippines-festival.jpg)

Do you prefer nightlife, drinking, party girls and general clubbing?

Then you should choose either Manila or Boracay as your home-base.

Both these densely-populated cities are famous for their abundance of bars, pubs, restaurants, cafes, clubs and club lounges.

The most popular party places are Palladium, Raven and Valkyrie in Manila.

Or, in Boracay, check out Epic Boracay, Area 51, and Club Paraw. You will never be disappointed, in either big cities.

**What about some lively festivals?**

Philippines festivals simply rock your world and the country seems like it's one big, long, continuous party place.

There are hundreds of festivals all year round, in various places in the country.

The MassKara festival is a costume and mask festival held every October, similar to the carnivals of Latin America. Remember the James Bond mexico opening scene, in Skyfall? You'll see the same at the MassKara festival. So cool.

A few other major events are 'The Ati-Atihan Festival', consisting of a week-long street celebration, held in the 3rd week of January.

Also the 'The Black Nazarene Procession' is a religious festival, on the 9th January, and on Good Friday.

## Girls, Girls and More Girls!

I saved the best til last.

Philippines girls (or Pinay or Filipinas) are well-known by 'men in the know' as being women much sought after.

**Why would I want a Filipino woman?**

Here are my own reasons why I keep yearning for the company of [Pinay companionship](https://pinayromances.com/blog/what-are-the-traits-personality-of-a-filipina-girl):-

- Attractiveness
  - An exquisite blend of beauty and character traits.
  - I prefer the slutty, Tan-Skinned Morena type of Philippines girls myself but they range from that to light-skinned tomato
- Fantastic charism
  - They possess a unique allure and beauty defined by centuries of ongoing change and culture.
  - Filipinas are borne mothers. They crave to have and raise cute children.
  - Pinay girls are a bunch of fun to be with, in all situations. And they are easy to [find on Filipina / Philippines dating sites](https://pinayromances.com/) too.
- Sweet natured
  - They are accepting of your physical looks whether you think you are ugly or handsome.
  - Filipinas will move hell and high-water to make their marriages work.
  - All Filipino women want their relationships to work and will move heaven and hell to do so. That's good for you!
- Friendliness and Respectful
  - Filipino girls always maintain long-lasting and strong friendships.
  - Pinay girls want older foreign men for relationships and marriage.
- Highly Sexual
  - These girls have the cultural Latino libidos, combined with the easy-going islander mentality to 'live for the moment'.
  - A Pinay's religious beliefs never get in the way of her high-octane sex drive. Yes, I can testify this is true, too.

## Closing

To be honest, I've already made plans to eventually move and stay in the Philippines. The only downside, at times, is the rainy season which isn't really that big of a deal.

First meet up and chat with some Filipino girls who will love to tell you why you need to come visit them and have a holiday together.

You owe it to yourself to try, right?
